<h2>TheQube 0.7</h2>

<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now the application is called TheQube (without a space) and versioned according to semantic versioning (<em>major.minor.patch</em>) system. And, until the first stable version is released, the first digit will be zero, so this version is 0.7.</li>
<li>The Speech and Braille panels in the global TheQube configuration are consolidated into one panel as the Braille panel contained only one check box.</li>
<li>The tweets translation service is back (<a href="https://github.com/Oire/TheQube/issues/27">#27</a>)</li>
<li>The audio links from rebranded AudioBoom are supported.</li>
<li>Now TheQube has a permanent <a href="http://theqube.oire.org">website</a></li>
<li>Now the website address in the profile info dialog won't be shortened with <em>t.co</em>.</li>
<li>Now the profile info dialog shows also the number of users that added the current user to their lists.</li>
<li>The <em>doc</em> folder is removed from sources as it doesn't contain any meaningful guidelines for TheQube developers. If the number of developers grows, such guidelines will be rewritten.</li>
<li>Temporarily removed support of the hkc.im URL shortener because of a service error, see <a href="http://hkc.im">their main page</a>. It can be brought back at any time, as soon as the service works again.</li>
<li>Added support for new URL shortening services, namely <em>goo.gl</em>, <em>senta.la</em>, and <em>Readability</em></li>
<li>The authorization process doesn't require a pin code anymore. However, the browser page still opens, we can't do anything to it so far (<a href="https://github.com/Oire/TheQube/issues/13">#13</a>)</li>
<li>Updated Spanish, Serbian, and Polish translations. Thanks to our translators team!</li>
